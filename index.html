                The courses I found most interesting were those related to programming, and I have managed myself to learn more 
                about several programming languages inside and outside of the courses. I am capable of reading and writing in 
                C and C++, and I am also capable of using JAVA and R. In addition, I have an entry level knowledge about data structure.
